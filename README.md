# jQuery-csp-inline-style-fix

This plugin is to overload the jQuery functionality of `.attr` when used with setting style.

This is very beta and hasn't been tested in bigger applications.

It's aim however is to prevent CSP warnings for using jQuery plugins that are styling elements by wrongly setting style attributes.
